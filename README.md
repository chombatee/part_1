HELLO ‚ò∫Ô∏è welcome to the CMCMS


The contract monthly claims management system  is a practical application created for Independent contractor lecturers to simplify the often complex claim submission and approval processes that lecturers and program co-ordinators struggle with it is a ASP.NET MVC application written in C#üë©üèæ‚Äçüíª

My aim during the development process to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and user satisfaction in claiming management.
This application was developed to allow users(lecturers and program coordinators ) be able to lecturers will submit monthly claims with calculated totals based on hours they worked and their hourly rates.to register by providing their full name, email, role, module, username and password.

Development breakdown :

The application allows users to register by providing their username, full name, email, role, module, and password.
I created The action method ‚ÄúRegisters‚Äù to handles the insertion of new user records into a database. It connects to the database and executes an INSERT SQL command to add a new user
User Login:

Users can log in using their email and password.
I names the action method ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù it will checks the users provided credentials against the database and updates the active user session in the database.
Logout Functionality
The ‚Äúlogout‚Äù method resets the active user status in the database and redirects to the index view.

Claims Submission:

The lectures  can submit claims by uploading supporting documents and providing details such as the module, claim date, period, hourly rate, hours worked, and a description.

A total claim amount  will automatically appear once hourly rate and total hours have been inserted 
our next action method is named ‚Äúclaiming‚Äù and it processes the uploaded file and stores the claim details in the database.

Claims Approval by program coordinator :

The program coordinators page has a functionality for approving or rejecting claims.

I created an action method named ‚Äúapproves‚Äù it  updates the status of claims in the database based on user input.

Dashboard and Profile Management:

Within this application includes ‚Äúviews ‚Äú for user dashboards and profiles, which will display user-specific information or claims for both lectures  program coordinators.
Error Handling:

Withing the  application there is  error handling for various operations, including database connections and file uploads.

Basic error handling is implemented using try-catch blocks, although it could be improved with more specific error messages and logging.


Database Connections:

We created a data base query to which the contract monthly claims management system  uses SqlConnection and SqlCommand from System.Data.SqlClient to interact with a SQL Server database. To save the data of all users.


File Uploads:

Update The application now allows users to upload  supporting files PDFs and Word documents related to their claims.
Uploaded files are saved in a designated folder within the wwwroot directory.
